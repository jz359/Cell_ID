athelas classifier plan

types: Neutrophils,	Lymphocytes, Basophils, Eosinophils, Monocytes

can probably use a decision tree first; SVM later?

1. threshold the image (everything that isnt blueish purple or bright pink should be set to black) RGB 150,140, 210
2. contour? or find objects in the image
3. if #contours > 1 --> NEUTROPHIL or MONOCYTE or LYMPHOCYTE
		-how do i do this lmao
4. if #contours = 1 --> could be BASOPHIL or ESINOPHIL
		-ESINOPHILs have those weird pink dots. should i keep the dots out of the thresholding?

5.

Problem: Still need to be able to tell when there are two or more different white cells in the same image. Bounding boxes?
